    <h1>Privacy Policy - Cloud Cost Watcher</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 2026</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to Cloud Cost Watcher! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when using our mobile app. By using Cloud Cost Watcher, you agree to the practices described here.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Authentication Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Account</strong>: When you sign in with Google Sign-In, we collect your name, email address, and unique account ID, as provided by Firebase Authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about how you interact with the app, such as monitored cloud costs (AWS, Azure, GCP), but we do not store sensitive financial data directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Technical Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device</strong>: Device model, operating system, app version, and unique identifiers (such as device ID).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Logs</strong>: Data about app sessions, errors, and performance, collected automatically by Firebase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Voluntary Data</h3>
    <p>Any additional information you provide when configuring cloud providers (such as API credentials), which are stored locally on the device or encrypted in Firestore.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication and Security</strong>: To verify your identity and protect your account.</li>
        <li><strong>App Functionality</strong>: To monitor and display cloud costs from supported providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).</li>
        <li><strong>Service Improvement</strong>: To analyze usage, fix bugs, and improve features.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications</strong>: To send notifications about costs or app updates (with your consent).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for commercial purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We share data with Firebase (Google) for authentication and storage, and with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) only to query costs, as per your permissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose data if required by law or to protect legal rights.</li>
        <li><strong>International Transfers</strong>: Data may be processed in Google servers (USA), subject to local laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption (TLS/SSL), Firebase authentication, and secure storage in Firestore. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>In accordance with the LGPD (Brazil's General Data Protection Law), you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal data.</li>
        <li>Revoke consent for processing.</li>
        <li>Request data portability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the email below.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data only as long as necessary for the purposes described. Authentication data is retained while your account is active; technical logs are deleted after 90 days.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically. We will notify you of significant changes via email or in-app notification. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
